                Rugby refers to the team sports rugby league and 
                rugby union, but generally refers to rugby union due 
                to its popularity throughout the globe.Legend claims 
                that rugby football was started about 1845 in Rugby 
                School, Rugby, Warwickshire, England, although forms 
                of football in which the ball was carried and tossed 
                date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into 
                two sports in 1895 when twenty-one amateur clubs split 
                from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the 
                Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU)/Northern Union 
                (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the 
                George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England
