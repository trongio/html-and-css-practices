            The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, 
            is an international association football competition contested
             by the senior men's national teams of the members of the 
            Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), 
            the sport's global governing body. The championship has been
             awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in
              1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because 
              of the Second World War. The current champion is France,
               which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.
