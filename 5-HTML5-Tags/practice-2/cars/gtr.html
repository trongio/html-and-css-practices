                Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced 
                a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car 
                proved to be iconic for Nissan[5][6] and achieved much fame and success on both road and track.

                The GT-R is an entirely new model, sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights.
                 Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS
                  system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT.[7] Because of the GT-R's heritage, the
                   chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35,[8] or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for emission standard), carrying on the 
                   naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations. The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, Godzilla,[9] given to it by the Australian
                    motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.
