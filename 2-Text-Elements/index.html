        <h1><i>January 14, 1997</i></h1>
        <p><b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the
             first version developed and standardized exclusively by the 
             <b>W3C</b>, as the <b>IETF</b> had closed its <b>HTML</b> <b>Working</b> 
             <b>Group</b>b> on September 12, 1996.â€‹Initially code-named 
             "Wilbur", <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, 
             reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions 
             and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. 
             <i>Netscape's blink</i> element and <i>Microsoft's</i>
              marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement 
              between the two companies.</p>
        <p>CSS is a cornerstone technology of 
            the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The name <i>cascading</i> comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style 
            rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
             This cascading <b>priority</b> scheme is predictable.</p>
        <p>A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML</p>
